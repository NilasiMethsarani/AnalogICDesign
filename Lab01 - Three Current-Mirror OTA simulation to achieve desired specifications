# EN4430 Analog IC Design - Assignment 01

This repository contains the design, analysis, and simulation files for Assignment 01 of the EN4430 Analog IC Design module, focusing on single-stage and two-stage Operational Transconductance Amplifiers (OTAs) using 45 nm CMOS technology.

## Project Overview

The project involves the design and simulation of:
- **Single-Stage OTA**: A differential amplifier with a current mirror biasing scheme and active load.
- **Two-Stage OTA**: A three current-mirror OTA with self-biased loads for enhanced gain and output swing.

Key tasks include:
- Device sizing calculations based on performance specifications (e.g., DC gain ≥ 40 dB, unity gain frequency ≥ 20 MHz, slew rate > 10 V/μs).
- Transient and AC analysis for open-loop and closed-loop configurations.
- Comparison of simulation results against design specifications.
